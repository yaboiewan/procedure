*IDEA135: Games at Work*
# Project 1: PROCEDURE

**Create a mini-game in p5.js that adapts one of the following:**

- A philosophical idea
- A religious law
- A federal or state law
- A surgical operation

## Rules

1. Your game must be based on a significant, pre-existing
philosophical idea, law, or operation (don't just make something up).
2. Your game must be interactive. The user's input (i.e. keyboard
strokes, mouse movements) must play a role in the outcome/direction of
the game.
3. Your game must be a game. Choose your favorite definition of a game
(see Salen/Zimmerman). You should be able to explain how your game
meets this definition's criteria.

## Learning Objectives

- Translate “non-ludic” systems of rules into a new format
- Write coherent and functional procedures in p5.js
- Develop facility with image-making technologies
- Use tools of synecdoche and metaphor to distill big ideas into an
  interactive artwork

## Deadlines

* Proposal (3/1/2017):
    - Write a two paragraph summary of your ideas (200 words or
      less). In the first paragraph, explain the idea/law/operation
      you are adapting. In the second paragraph, describe how it will
      be translated into game form. Describe what your your videogame
      will look like and what will the game play will entail.
    - Create a set of sprites that may be used in your game.
    
* Work in Progress (3/6/2017)
    - Create a simple p5 script (or series of scripts) in which you
      arrange your sprites in a canvas to give a clear idea of what
      your game looks like and what the game play entails. This sketch
      should include animated and interactive elements. You should be
      able to describe to the class what you still still need to do to
      finish your game.

* Final (3/13/2017)
